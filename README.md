# Flipping Nth Characters

This code will flip every chunk of 'nth' characters in a string, where n is any positive integer greater than 1. It will then test the expected outcome with the actual outcome to confirm it did as expected.

Example:<br >
var input = 'a short example'; <br>
var output = flipEveryNChars(input, 5); --> 'ohs axe trelpma'
